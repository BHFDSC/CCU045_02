## Project description

This study aims to address key evidence gaps in the understanding of hospitalised heart failure in England, particularly over the COVID-19 pandemic period. Despite the increasing burden of heart failure, its contemporary epidemiology in this setting remains incompletely characterised, especially with respect to trends in re-hospitalisation and mortality, differences between heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the impact of co-existing chronic medical conditions, and the implementation of newer guideline-recommended therapies.
